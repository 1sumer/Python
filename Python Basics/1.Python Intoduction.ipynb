    "### **Why Python?**\n",
    "- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way."

    "### **Disadvantages of Python Programming Language:**\n",
    "- **Performance:** Python is an interpreted language, which means that it can be slower than compiled languages like C or Java. This can be an issue for performance-intensive tasks.\n",
    "- **Memory consumption:** Python can consume a lot of memory, especially when working with large datasets or running complex algorithms.\n",
    "- **Dynamically typed:** Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that the types of variables can change at runtime. This can make it more difficult to catch errors and can lead to bugs.\n",
    "- **Packaging and versioning:** Python has a large number of packages and libraries, which can sometimes lead to versioning issues and package conflicts.\n",
    "- **Steep learning curve:** While Python is generally considered to be a relatively easy language to learn, it can still have a steep learning curve for beginners, especially if they have no prior experience with programming."

    "- Compiled codes run faster than Interpreter. \n",

    "- Object code is permanently saved for future use.\n",
    "- C, C++, C#, etc are programming languages that are compiler-based.\n",

    "### Interpreter\n",
    "- An interpreter executes code line by line.\n",
    "- The Interpreter does not save the Machine Language.\n",
    "- Interpreted codes run slower than Compiler.\n",
    "- The interpreter does not generate any output.\n",
    "- Any change in the source program during the translation does not require retranslation of the entire code.\n",
    "- Errors are displayed in every single line.\n",
    "- It requires source code for later execution.\n",
    "- Execution of the program happens after every line is checked or evaluated.\n",
    "- In comparison, Interpreters take less time for analyzing the source code.\n",
