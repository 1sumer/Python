    "Exploratory Data Analysis refers to an approach of analyzing and summarizing the data often with visual methods. We want to use data as a tool to help us solve problems and make better decisions, but when we use it to validate our own assumptions, we are going in the wrong direction. The idea behind this is to understand the data without biased assumptions.\n"
